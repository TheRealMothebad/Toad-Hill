# toad bash game

11.7.2022 tobin cooney:
'ello i'm gonna make a bash version of the game, inspired partially by (kaes' toadRL)[https://github.com/hyprlynk/toadRL/], something that can run in just bash, using like tput and stuff or something. But also we could make our own typeface to make this look nice later. there's some game that does something like that, i forget what it is. but i like the idea of having the exact same program run in two modes, one with normal typeface ascii and one with our custom textures


- turns can consist of like 5 or 10 or 20 moves and they get played out with a delay so you can do multiplayer
