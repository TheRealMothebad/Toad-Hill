Welcome to Toad Hill! Here you will find all the wonderful teacups and seedcakes that you should require on your travels. I first would like to ask of you the following: what do you seek here at our wonderful hilltop on this fine spring evening? [the saga will continue in our next exciting episode of this new and evolving Choose your Own Adventure chronicle]

"fame, fortune, and functional harmony"

"I am a toad assassin and my work is rather simple,
Take one more mis’rable creature here and pop him like a pimple,
These frogs’s fates are sealed the moment mugs enter my sights,
An amphibious hitman has what is truly quite the life."
