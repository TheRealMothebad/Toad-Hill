> The weather is starting to turn, so you all gather beneath the hill. Among the sea of toads bustling around the floor of the opening (all in exquisite dress, thoroughly respectable folk), you see that the kind toads have presented you all with a selection of sturdy old teacups, and a basket of fresh seedcakes. The procession of toads carrying these to you set down their baskets, step out from under them, and give a polite little bob before bloomphing on away.
