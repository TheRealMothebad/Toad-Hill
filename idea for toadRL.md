# idea about toadRL
also kinda goes with the image of the game in [[zork-ish text-based adventure game]]
- separate story, but in world, down in the toad archives
- what about a multiplayer roguelike? it could never work as anything resembling an MMO, but as like a turn-based thing in a small group, but async. like what's that game. diplomacy?
	- what if you blocked out a couple turns per player? well no then everyone else would see npc's moving way too fast
