Keepers of the nop

dungeon crawl stone soup first two levels of the tutorial: like minecrsft aadl level. i thonk i get it now. its a game. like a stoey gsme its preyyu good.


- zork: 
- the VIBES though. little gem egg. but less the dungeon crawl and more the mystery story
- on a similar note, roguelikes could totally have a more home-ish-ness. what about the mouse wizard catacombs? Maybe toad is where the deep old magic and collapsed civilization overlaps the little creature children running over the hills. And it's got a middleground of the formality of the toads, and the city supermodern dissociation/derealization vibe
- look into how they made zork & its words database other irrelevant stuff
- thinking of it like an rpg a little bit though, can it not be like that kinda? (google classroom stories, this was a bit of the direction that the initial design was taking)
