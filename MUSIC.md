##### notes abt. music
- "why put a toad in the context of an orchestra when you could put an orchestra in the context of a toad"
- the idea that you're using a orchestra to talk about toads. (See note in music folder, "postmodern-note.pdf")
- rachmaninoff piano concerto?
- or chiptune music arranged so that it could be played on the piano all heartfelt
- it would be really fun to pair live stuff with like chiptune, like a string quartet & little square wave synth sounds from beepbox together for the ball
