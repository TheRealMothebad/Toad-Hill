# why
why the toads. what's the direction here
- on why branch, getting some direction & then laying out what to do here

## GAME::
>> discord bot
   - a way to interact with the story
   - giving instructions/your move
>> toadRL
   - darn cool
   - has a use for the whole json data storage stuff too
   - it would be so darn fun to have it work in terminal too, ascii version. like the same content, rendered differently if you run a different script.
     - when does main.py call on the engine stuff?
   - what about a multiplayer roguelike? it could never work as anything resembling an MMO, but as like a turn-based thing in a small group, but async. like what's that game. diplomacy?
     - what if you blocked out a couple turns per player? well no then everyone else would see npc's moving way too fast
>> the initial zork-ish text-based adventure game (does that genre have a name?)
   - the VIBES though. little gem egg. but less the dungeon crawl and more the mystery story
   - on a similar note, roguelikes could totally have a more home-ish-ness. what about the mouse wizard catacombs? Maybe toad is where the deep old magic and collapsed civilization overlaps the little creature children running over the hills. And it's got a middleground of the formality of the toads, and the city supermodern dissociation/derealization vibe
   - look into how they made zork & its words database



- thinking of it like an rpg a little bit though, can it not be like that kinda?

- rachmaninoff piano concerto?
  - or chiptune music arranged so that it could be played on the piano all heartfelt
- it would be really fun to pair live stuff with like chiptune, like a string quartet & little square wave synth sounds from beepbox together for the ball



i want you to play this game in the evening with a cup of tea at the table, and a laptop. it's a fun little safe little story. what ~does~ happen if you attack the toads? then you've just made a different game. with something zork-like you could take so many different roads
