# why
why the toads. what's the direction here

##GAME::
>> discord bot
   - a way to interact with the story
>> toadRL
   - darn cool
   - has a use for the whole json data storage stuff too
>> the initial zork-ish text-based adventure game (does that genre have a name?)
   - the VIBES though. little gem egg. but less the dungeon crawl and more the mystery story
   - on a similar note, roguelikes could totally have a more home-ish-ness. what about the mouse wizard catacombs? Maybe toad is where the deep old magic and collapsed civilization overlaps the little creature children running over the hills. And it's got a middleground of the formality of the toads, and the city supermodern dissociation/derealization vibe

- thinking of it like an rpg a little bit though, can it not be like that kinda?
- what about a multiplayer roguelike? it could never work as anything resembling an MMO, but as like a turn-based thing in a small group, but async. like what's that game. diplomacy?
- rachmaninoff piano concerto?
  - or chiptune music arranged so that it could be played on the piano all heartfelt
