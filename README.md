- darn cool
- separate story, but in world, down in the toad archives
- what about a multiplayer roguelike? it could never work as anything resembling an MMO, but as like a turn-based thing in a small group, but async. like what's that game. diplomacy?
	- what if you blocked out a couple turns per player? well no then everyone else would see npc's moving way too fast

## music
- working on the music
  - "why put a toad in the context of an orchestra when you could put an orchestra in the context of a toad"
  - the idea that you're using a orchestra to talk about toads. (See note in music folder, "postmodern-note.pdf")
