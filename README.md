# Toad-Hill
A Toad Hill production

Tobin's test branch:
trying to set up both the story architecture and the bot to manage i/o
I'm setting this up more as a story editing thing, so we can handle branching between all the characters and individual story segments, but also let everyone see each other's movements...
Useful as a test branch while setting up the structure of the code that we can use between the different versions, but probably going to diverge as we get into the separate versions (is the main branch more zork-ish? i don't know how this is working yet, we'll figure it out)
